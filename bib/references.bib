  abstract = {We often face obstacles to visit certain places, facilities, and institutions. This was especially noticeable during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this period telepresence applications were of exceptional importance. They supported communications and provided social interactions, enriching our lives during isolation. In this paper, we propose a solution for telepresence using Padbot U1 robot and the MQTT protocol. The idea is to use this solution for virtual tours in museums, art galleries, historical sites, etc. We have developed two different applications. One is a client application used by the visitor, for controlling the robot remotely. The other application is for the mobile device (tablet) attached to the robot, which is used to enable telepresence and to forward control commands to the robot. By scanning the QR codes placed on the objects, visitors can also get specific information about each of objects. Communication between applications (sending commands and receiving information for objects) is realized with the MQTT protocol. For the developed solution, we also conducted experiments to evaluate some basic criteria for VTs.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the attention that the humanoid robots gained has led us to their inclusion in a wide variety of application areas, and more to come in the following years. Nowadays we have access to a variety of robots, from application area to new forms of interaction. Pepper, the humanoid robot made in 2014 by Aldebaran Robotics, is created to establish a natural connection with a human. The primary goal of Pepper is set to improve people daily routines and to entertain. Our objective would be for Pepper to behave like a museum guide welcoming visitors, accompanying them through the museum, and providing information about the exhibits that the visitors are stopping by.},

  abstract = {The museum is changing from a place of passive consumption to a place of interactive experiences, opening up new ways of engaging with exhibits and others. As a promising direction, this paper explores the potential of telepresence stations in the museum context to enhance social connectedness among visitors over distance. Emphasizing the significance of social exchange, our research focuses on studying telepresence to foster interactions between strangers, share knowledge, and promote social connectedness. To do so, we first observe exhibitions and then interview individual visitors of a technical museum about their experiences and needs. Based on the results, we design appropriate voiceless and touchless communication channels and test them in a study. The findings of our in-situ user study with 24 visitors unfamiliar with each other in the museum provide insights into behaviors and perceptions, contributing valuable knowledge on seamlessly integrating telepresence technology in exhibitions, with a focus on enhancing learning, social connections, and the museum experience in general.},

Our entire healthcare system has been under unprecedented strain, and going forward, we must consider how robotic technology could help improve the quality of care and day-to-day functionality of our care facilities. Herein, we present our human-robot interaction study in a local long-term care centre during the pandemic and the lessons learned from deploying a SAR to screen staff members. We investigate staff acceptance and the influence of demographics on perceptions of the SAR. Results show that overall, staff were positive about the screening robot, and that autonomous screening with a social robot is a potential application in long-term care homes. We further detail the challenges and future opportunities to develop SARs, including recommendations to successfully implement and adopt these robots in a post-pandemic society.},

  abstract = {Over the years, the purpose of cultural heritage (CH) sites (e.g., museums) has focused on providing personalized services to different users, with the main goal of adapting those services to the visitors’ personal traits, goals, and interests. In this work, we propose a computational cognitive model that provides an artificial agent (e.g., robot, virtual assistant) with the capability to personalize a museum visit to the goals and interests of the user that intends to visit the museum by taking into account the goals and interests of the museum curators that have designed the exhibition. In particular, we introduce and analyze a special type of help (critical help) that leads to a substantial change in the user’s request, with the objective of taking into account the needs that the same user cannot or has not been able to assess. The computational model has been implemented by exploiting the multi-agent oriented programming (MAOP) framework JaCaMo, which integrates three different multi-agent programming levels. We provide the results of a pilot study that we conducted in order to test the potential of the computational model. The experiment was conducted with 26 real participants that have interacted with the humanoid robot Nao, widely used in Human-Robot interaction (HRI) scenarios.},

@article{Kaito,
  abstract = {A visitor-following method that guides visitors as they move around was successfully developed without changing the structure of the waypoint navigation system. We previously developed a guidance robot, “EM-Ro,” to provide guidance services at the ECO35 Muffler Museum, and used the waypoint navigation system to implement a visitor-escort method along a predetermined route. With this visitor-following method, EM-Ro was able to follow a target visitor along visitor-derived waypoints, which were estimated using 2D LiDAR. Thus, the proposed navigation system for the guidance robot provides both visitor-escort and visitor-following guidance services. Using the same waypoint navigation system, it was possible to seamlessly switch between visitor-escort and visitor-following guidance. Switching between prepared or visitor-derived waypoints can make a visitor choose the preferred guidance method. Visitors can switch the guidance method anytime by providing EM-Ro requests from the remote controller. In addition, a guest redetecting method was developed when EM-Ro lost guests. The experimental results at the Muffler Museum showed that both visitor-escort and visitor-following driving by the EM-Ro were successfully demonstrated while guiding guests in the facility.},

@article{Markku,
  abstract = {In this paper, we analyze how different path aspects affect a user’s experience, mainly VR sickness and overall comfort, while immersed in an autonomously moving telepresence robot through a virtual reality headset. In particular, we focus on how the robot turns and the distance it keeps from objects, with the goal of planning suitable trajectories for an autonomously moving immersive telepresence robot in mind; rotational acceleration is known for causing the majority of VR sickness, and distance to objects modulates the optical flow. We ran a within-subjects user study (n = 36, women = 18) in which the participants watched three panoramic videos recorded in a virtual museum while aboard an autonomously moving telepresence robot taking three different paths varying in aspects such as turns, speeds, or distances to walls and objects. We found a moderate correlation between the users’ sickness as measured by the SSQ and comfort on a 6-point Likert scale across all paths. However, we detected no association between sickness and the choice of the most comfortable path, showing that sickness is not the only factor affecting the comfort of the user. The subjective experience of turn speed did not correlate with either the SSQ scores or comfort, even though people often mentioned turning speed as a source of discomfort in the open-ended questions. Through exploring the open-ended answers more carefully, a possible reason is that the length and lack of predictability also play a large role in making people observe turns as uncomfortable. A larger subjective distance from walls and objects increased comfort and decreased sickness both in quantitative and qualitative data. Finally, the SSQ subscales and total weighted scores showed differences by age group and by gender.},

  abstract = {While telepresence robots have increasingly become accepted in diverse settings, the research on their acceptance in educational contexts has been underdeveloped. This study analyzed how the use intention of telepresence robots can be influenced by perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, subjective norm, and perceived risk for students, faculty, and staff in higher education. Survey data were collected from 60 participants with direct operator experience with a variety of telepresence robots deployed in a large research university in the Midwest region of the United States. Path analysis results indicated that perceived usefulness was the only significant direct predictor of use intention of telepresence robots. Both perceived ease of use and subjective norm had a significant positive effect on perceived usefulness. Subjective norm also had a significant positive indirect effect on use intention, mediated by perceived usefulness. Perceived risk had a negative effect on perceived ease of use. These findings indicated that the usefulness of robots was central to operators’ decisions to use telepresence robots. Therefore, design choice for telepresence robots should prioritize usefulness. Secondly, the design of telepresence robots should minimize complexity for the end user and minimize cognitive demand. Having nominal difficulty of use would also facilitate multiple embodiments by combining telepresence robots with other technologies to support more rich social interactions.},

  abstract = {Social robots are increasingly used within public spaces, including museum settings. This quasi-systematic review identifies and synthesizes the evidence on social robots that have recently been deployed in museum settings. It specifically focuses on their intended purpose, their acceptability and factors important for successful human–robot interaction in this setting. Four databases (PsycINFO, SCOPUS, ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore) were systematically searched to retrieve literature published within the last 10 years on human–robot interaction studies with social robots deployed in museum settings. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the studies, qualitative and quantitative findings were summarized. A total of 604 items were identified, of which 12 were included in the review. Robots in 11 studies were physical and 1 was an embodied conversational agent presented as a virtual robot. In 75% of the studies (n = 9), the purpose of the robots was to act as museum guides, while in 17% (n = 2) they entertained visitors and in 8% (n = 1) the robot taught visitors in a museum outreach programme. Overall, many of the robots were found to be acceptable for use within museum settings. Three main themes for successful social human–robot interaction were evident across the findings: (1) facial expressions, (2) movement and (3) communication and speech. There is a great opportunity for social robots to be deployed within museum settings, as guides, educators, entertainers or a combination thereof. State-of-the-art methods have led to the development of museum robots that are more capable of social interaction; however, more work is required to develop speech capabilities that work in the ‘wild’. Future work should combine the factors that have been identified within this review to improve human–robot interaction.},

@article{Tiina,
  abstract = {Purpose This study aims to enhance the understanding of the current research landscape regarding the utilisation of telepresence robots (TPRs) in education. Design/methodology/approach The bibliometric and thematic analysis of research publications on TPRs was conducted using papers in the Scopus database up to 2023. The final analysis focused on 53 papers that adhered to the selection criteria. A qualitative analysis was performed on this set of papers. Findings The analysis found a rising trend in TPR publications, mostly from the USA as conference papers and journal articles. However, these publications lacked technology integration frameworks, acceptance models and specific learning design models. TPRs have proven effective in various learning environments, fostering accessible education, better communication, engagement and social presence. TPRs can bridge geographical gaps, facilitate knowledge sharing and promote collaboration. Obstacles to implementation include technical, physical, social and emotional challenges. Publications were grouped into four thematic categories: didactic methods of using TPRs, TPRs for educational inclusivity, TPR as a teacher mediator and challenges in using TPRs. Despite the significant potential of TPRs, their broader adoption in education is still facing challenges. Research limitations/implications This research solely analysed research papers in the Scopus database, limiting TPR publications with the keywords “telepresence robots”, “learning”, “teaching” and “education”, excluding studies with different other keywords. Originality/value This study enhances understanding of TPR research in education, highlighting its pedagogical implications. It identifies a gap in the inclusion of technology integration frameworks, acceptance models and learning design models, indicating a need for further research and development.},
