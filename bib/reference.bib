  abstract = {The museum is changing from a place of passive consumption to a place of interactive experiences, opening up new ways of engaging with exhibits and others. As a promising direction, this paper explores the potential of telepresence stations in the museum context to enhance social connectedness among visitors over distance. Emphasizing the significance of social exchange, our research focuses on studying telepresence to foster interactions between strangers, share knowledge, and promote social connectedness. To do so, we first observe exhibitions and then interview individual visitors of a technical museum about their experiences and needs. Based on the results, we design appropriate voiceless and touchless communication channels and test them in a study. The findings of our in-situ user study with 24 visitors unfamiliar with each other in the museum provide insights into behaviors and perceptions, contributing valuable knowledge on seamlessly integrating telepresence technology in exhibitions, with a focus on enhancing learning, social connections, and the museum experience in general.},

  abstract = {Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.},
